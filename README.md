## ðŸš€ Quick start

**Clone, install CLI, run.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd prist/
    gatsby develop
    ```

**Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
